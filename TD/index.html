In addition, owing to its novel point ofview, we believe that this book allows readers who alreadyhave a working knowledge of thermodynamics to gain a new appreciation for the depth andbeauty of its theoretical structure. It is suited to serveas a textbook for a single-semester college course.  We recommend structuring such a coursein accordance with the organization of topics presented in the first half of the book.(A recommended outline for such use is presented at the end ofSection 1.3.) This book covers a great deal of material, but that presented in the last fewchapters is not necessary for a general knowledge of the field. From the firstsix chapters, the reader can gain a deep understanding of the fundamental nature ofthermodynamics and the concept of entropy. Adding Chapter 7, the reader can also becomeacquainted with some basic applications of this theoretical framework.<p>Our goal in writing this book was to present the theoretical system of thermodynamics ina clear and logical form that brings its concepts to life. In addition, we have aimed topresent content and arguments that form a complete understanding, with the stance thatthe reader (or the instructor) should not be left feeling that somethinghas been glossed over or left vague. This emphasis on clarity and logic begins with the manner in whichwe construct the overall theory and present the relations between the individual arguments in thisconstruction to the whole, and it extends to the manner in which we form and lay out these argumentsand the computations they contain. In addition, we attempt to elucidate the relation between the theorydiscussed here and the larger frameworks of physics and natural science in general, with the intentionof providing the reader with a clear understanding of the position that thermodynamics occupies withinthe general scientific framework as well as the peculiar point of view that it offers.<hr width="70%">In this book we present the theory of thermodynamics through a novel reconstruction.While the content of this theory itself is, of course,that of the conventional theory, the point of view that we take in its construction differs from that taken inconventional textbooks. The fundamental manner of thinking employed in this book is the following:<BLOCKQUOTE>We consider thermodynamics from an operational point of view in which the most importantconcept is work. After individually studying isothermal operations (and the second law)and adiabatic operations (and the first law), we seek a framework within which both can be understood.In this way, the overall structure of thermodynamics naturally takes form.</BLOCKQUOTE>The above overview may be difficult to understand at this point, but it will become clear in the followingchapters.<p>Our purpose in presenting an alternative to the conventional instructional method, which has existed for morethan one hundred years, is not simply to display our eccentricity. Rather, like many physicists, we foundthe conventional approach to thermodynamics difficult to understand, and, while studying a number of modern works,we searched for a clearer approach. The formulation presented here is the result of that search.</div><!-- *********** info *********** --><!--    My standard signature   --><hr><address>Hal Tasaki<br>Department of Physics, Gakushuin University<br><a href="https://haltasaki.github.io/">Hal Tasaki's web page</a></address></body></html>
